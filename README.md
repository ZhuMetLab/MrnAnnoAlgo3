**Knowledge and Data-driven Two-layer Networking for Accurate Metabolite Annotation in Untargeted Metabolomics**

`MrnAnnoAlgo3` is the core algorithm module of **MetDNA3**, designed to annotate metabolites through a two-layer interactive networking topology (knowledge-driven and data-driven) and recursive annotation propagation algorithms. It provides a robust computational foundation for large-scale metabolomic studies.
**For full functionality, please use [MetDNA3](http://metdna.zhulab.cn/).**

## Key Features
‚ú® **Two-Layer Networking Topology**  
Integrates **knowledge-driven** (biochemical pathways, metabolic reaction networks) and **data-driven** (experimental MS2 similarity networks) layers for comprehensive and accurate metabolite annotation.

‚ö° **Recursive Annotation Propagation Algorithm**  
An efficient topology-based annotation propagation algorithm leveraging both network layers to enhance annotation coverage and accuracy.

üìä **High Performance**  
Processes a typical untargeted metabolomics dataset in just one hour‚Äîover **10√ó faster** than previous versions.

üîó **Seamless Integration**  
Designed as a core component of the MetDNA3 ecosystem.  *Note: Full MetDNA3 functionality requires additional modules.*
